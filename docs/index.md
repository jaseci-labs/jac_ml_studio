# Documentation Index

This documentation covers the Jac synthetic data pipeline for both maintainers and dataset consumers. Start with the README for a quick entry point, then use these pages for the operational details.

## Reading Paths

- Maintainers: [`pipeline.md`](pipeline.md), [`dataset.md`](dataset.md), [`quality.md`](quality.md), [`operations.md`](operations.md), then [`tasks/`](tasks/).
- Dataset consumers: [`stats.md`](stats.md), [`dataset.md`](dataset.md), [`quality.md`](quality.md), and release artifacts under `dataset/releases/` when a version is frozen.
- Operators scaling data: [`operations.md`](operations.md), [`scale_runbook.md`](scale_runbook.md), and [`tasks/task6.md`](tasks/task6.md).
- Full-app strategy reviewers: [`newdatagenstrat/`](newdatagenstrat/) for the proposed Claude Code + Jac MCP app-generation workflow.
- Model selection: [`modeltesting/`](modeltesting/) for the 3-model comparison strategy (Gemma 4, Qwen3-Coder, DeepSeek-V3-Lite) on 5k sample data before full-scale generation, starting with the single-category [`modeltesting/conversion_probe.md`](modeltesting/conversion_probe.md) pre-step.

## Pages

- [`context.md`](context.md): strategy, category goals, and high-level generation rationale.
- [`pipeline.md`](pipeline.md): end-to-end generation, validation, review, dedupe, and release flow.
- [`dataset.md`](dataset.md): artifact layout, metadata contract, IDs, versions, and category schemas.
- [`quality.md`](quality.md): compiler gates, pass-rate thresholds, manual review criteria, and duplicate handling.
- [`operations.md`](operations.md): commands for readiness, stats, scale planning, manual review, trajectory ingestion, audit, and freeze.
- [`stats.md`](stats.md): generated dataset snapshot from current repository artifacts.
- [`scale_runbook.md`](scale_runbook.md): detailed scale and release runbook.
- [`newdatagenstrat/`](newdatagenstrat/): proposed full-app generation strategy with tests, repair loops, MCP/plugin validation, and DPO logging.
- Cross-compiled test validation, Python source filtering, type inference from test execution, and multi-candidate translation are documented throughout the pipeline docs following the MultiPL-T methodology (Cassano et al. 2024).
- [`modeltesting/`](modeltesting/): model comparison strategy and evaluation methodology for testing Gemma 4 26B A4B, Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B, and DeepSeek-V3-Lite on a 5k example sample before committing to full-scale generation.
- [`tasks/`](tasks/): roadmap and task-by-task build plan for the pipeline.
- Additional generation and verification techniques are adopted from a set of code-LLM papers (WizardCoder, Magicoder/OSS-Instruct, DeepSeek-Coder, DeepSeek-Coder-V2, Magpie, CodeDPO, SelfCodeAlign): snippet-seeded and zero-seed generation, credibility-ranked DPO, runtime-efficiency pairs, semantic-domain coverage, FIM data, repo-level synthetic projects, and token accounting. See `newdatagenstrat/` and `wholestack/`.

## Source Of Truth

The docs intentionally point back to code-backed definitions:

- `src/data_generation/foundation.py` defines categories, storage paths, metadata fields, and ID helpers.
- `src/data_generation/prompt_design.py` defines prompt templates, prompt versions, schemas, and prompt guardrails.
- `src/data_generation/validation.py` defines validation stages, compiler field policies, retry limits, and thresholds.
- `src/data_generation/manual_review.py` defines review criteria and review status workflows.
- `src/data_generation/release.py` defines readiness, audit, deduplication, manifest, and freeze behavior.
- `src/data_generation/python_source.py` defines Python source filtering, test generation, type inference, and source pool management.
- `src/data_generation/test_compiler.py` defines the deterministic Python-to-Jac test compiler for cross-compiled test validation.
- `src/data_generation/credibility.py` defines CodeDPO-style mutual code↔test credibility scoring, DPO pair construction, and runtime-efficiency pairs.
- `src/data_generation/tokens.py` defines per-example and aggregate token accounting.
- `src/data_generation/docs_stats.py` generates the stats page from current artifacts.
