# Process — how to run the conversion probe

Start-to-finish for the mini model test: finetune one base model on the
Python→Jac conversion data and measure base-vs-finetuned on the held-out set.
Everything is built; this is the run order.

## 0. Prereqs (one time)

Anaconda was removed on purpose. Use the project venv:

```bash
./setup_env.sh                 # python3 -m venv .venv + pip install jaclang mlx-lm matplotlib
source .venv/bin/activate      # puts jac + mlx_lm.* on PATH
```

You also need disk for a model (~50–60 GB per model to download + quantize).

## 1. Sanity check the toolchain + data

```bash
./check.sh
```

Expect: `20 passed` (full `jac check`) and `32/32 re-validated` (behavior). If
that's green, jac + the pipeline work.

## 2. Confirm the data is in place

Already generated (gitignored under `dataset/`):

| File | What | Count |
|---|---|---|
| `dataset/mlx/train.jsonl` + `valid.jsonl` | training split (mlx `messages` format, 1:3 idiom:transpile) | 417 / 47 |
| `dataset/eval_holdout/conversion.jsonl` | unseen, decontaminated eval tasks (behavioral `test_cases`) | 150 |
| `dataset/conversion/dpo.jsonl` | DPO pairs (later stage) | 85 |

Rebuild only if the data changed:

```bash
jac run srccurrent/jacgen/seed_conversion.jac     # idiomatic core
jac run srccurrent/jacgen/idiomatic_batch.jac     # + batches 2/3
jac run srccurrent/jacgen/scale_conversion.jac    # transpile volume (1500)
jac run srccurrent/jacgen/build_manifest.jac      # 1:3 balanced sft_train.jsonl
jac run srccurrent/jacgen/build_splits.jac        # -> dataset/mlx/{train,valid}.jsonl
jac run srccurrent/jacgen/holdout.jac             # eval holdout (decontaminated)
jac run srccurrent/jacgen/dataset_stats.jac       # composition report
```

## 3. Run the probe

```bash
./run_probe.sh Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B qwen
# or:  ./run_probe.sh google/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it gemma
```

What it does, in order:
1. quantize the model → Q4 (train) + Q8 (eval)
2. **base eval** on the 150 holdout → `results/qwen-base.txt`
3. **30-iter dry-run** — bail check (loss drops, no NaN/OOM); Ctrl-C within 8s to abort
4. **train** (LoRA SFT, `configs/lora.yaml`) with a **live dashboard** every ~60s
   (train/val loss, LR, tokens/sec, and the holdout test-pass **learning curve**
   from a 50-task per-checkpoint eval)
5. **fuse** adapter → Q8
6. **finetuned eval** on the 150 holdout → `results/qwen-finetuned.txt`
7. **graphs** → `results/*.png`

Tunables (env): `EVAL_EVERY` (dashboard secs), `SUBSET` (tasks/checkpoint),
`DRY_ITERS`, `SKIP_DRY=1`.

## 4. Read the result

- **Primary metric:** cross-compiled test pass rate, base vs finetuned, in
  `results/qwen-base.txt` vs `results/qwen-finetuned.txt`. The delta is the signal:
  did finetuning on our Jac data make the model produce more correct Jac?
- **`results/learning_curve.png`** — pass-rate per checkpoint. Rising = it's
  learning Jac; flat-while-loss-drops = it's memorizing format, not idiom.
- Live view during training: the ASCII dashboard (auto-refreshed), or manually
  `JAC_TRAIN_LOG=results/qwen-train.log JAC_METRICS=results/qwen-metrics.jsonl jac run srccurrent/jacgen/dashboard.jac`.

## Pausing / resuming (close the laptop anytime)

`run_probe.sh` is **resumable** — kill it, shut down, or re-run, and it continues:

- It runs under `caffeinate`, so it won't idle-sleep mid-run.
- **Lid close / sleep:** the process suspends and **continues on wake** — nothing lost.
- **Shutdown / kill / crash:** just re-run the same command. It skips finished
  stages (quantize, base eval) via `results/.<name>.*.done` markers and **resumes
  LoRA training from the last saved checkpoint** (mlx saves every 100 steps to
  `adapters/<name>-probe/`), training only the remaining iters. The learning-curve
  metrics append rather than reset.

**Auto-resume after a full shutdown** (optional — re-runs itself at login): create
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.jaseci.probe.plist`, then `launchctl load` it:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0"><dict>
  <key>Label</key><string>com.jaseci.probe</string>
  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string>/bin/bash</string><string>-lc</string>
    <string>cd /Users/ayush/Downloads/JaseciLabs/DataGeneration && ./run_probe.sh Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B qwen >> results/qwen-autoresume.log 2>&1</string>
  </array>
  <key>RunAtLoad</key><true/>
</dict></plist>
```

`launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.jaseci.probe.plist`. On every login it
re-runs; once finished, all stages are `*.done` and it exits immediately. Remove
with `launchctl unload ...` when the probe is complete.

## Time (rough, M5 Pro, first run)

Highly variable — dominated by download, training, and 30B-model generation.

| Stage | Estimate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Download model (FP16 ~60 GB) | 10 min – 2.5 hr | network-bound; one-time (cached after) |
| Quantize Q4 + Q8 | ~15–30 min | one-time |
| Base eval (150 tasks) | ~15–40 min | generation on the 30B model |
| LoRA train (600 iters) | ~0.5–1.7 hr | + per-checkpoint eval competes for the GPU |
| Per-checkpoint evals | ~0.3–1 hr | the live 50-task evals, concurrent with training |
| Fuse + final eval | ~0.3–0.7 hr | |
| **Total (first run)** | **~3–6 hr** | subsequent runs skip download/quantize → **~2–4 hr** |

**Cut the time:** the per-checkpoint eval on a 30B model is the hidden cost (it
shares the GPU with training). Run with `SUBSET=20 EVAL_EVERY=300 ./run_probe.sh ...`
to eval fewer tasks less often, or `EVAL_EVERY=99999` to skip live evals and just
read base-vs-finetuned at the end.

## Notes / limits

- **SFT first.** DPO is a later stage (mlx-lm native DPO is unconfirmed);
  `dpo.jsonl` is ready when you get there.
- The eval calls the converted function by its `func_name` (or the name the model
  defines); a model that produces no callable scores as wrong (fair).
- `configs/lora.yaml` keys vary by mlx-lm version — verify against your install
  (`mlx_lm.lora --help`) before the real run.
- To compare two models, run `run_probe.sh` twice and diff the `-finetuned.txt`
  results (same data, same config — only the base model differs).
